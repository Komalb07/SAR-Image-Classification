# SAR-Image-Classification

In this work, Filtering and Classification of SAR images were performed to extract useful information. SAR images are often affected by various types of noise, such as speckle noise, caused by the coherent nature of the radar signal. Filtering can help to reduce this noise and make the image more interpretable. Firstly, SAR images are filtered using various imaging filters like Mean, Median, Gaussian, Refined lee and Boxcar filters and their performance is evaluated based on their Mean_Squared_Error(MSE) values, and then classified into urban, water bodies, and vegetation. Manual classification by using image interpretation techniques requires more time and field experts. So in this work, we focused on efficient automatic SAR image classification. Various machine learning algorithms like K-Means clustering for unsupervised classification, Support vector machine, Decision tree, and Random forest for supervised classification are used.
